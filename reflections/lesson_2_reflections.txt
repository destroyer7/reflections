Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Git creates and stores some metadata in a hidden folder named .git. Once you initialize a repository,
you can make commits and track the changes you make efficiently.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area is used when you want to commit only specific files. Add the files you want to commit to the staging
area using git add file_name. Sometimes, you may not want to commit changes to many files in one commit. It would be
useful when you initialize a repository because you can commit each file in a separate commit. Or you could commit 
specific groups of files together.
