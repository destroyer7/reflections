Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A: It would be useful when there are a lot of people working on your repository or
when you would be working on different computers at different times

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:If other people have made changes in remote, you will be pulling all these changes,
sometimes you might not want this. You may want to continue on your own work 

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally?
A: If something gets updated on GitHub only, then we merge those changes into our
local master with git pull origin/master.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
A: By sharing files via pen-drives & e-mail. The only easy thing is that it would 
not necessarily need an internet connection.
